Goroutines for Concurrent API Requests in Go


This repository contains a sample implementation of making concurrent API requests in Go using Goroutines. By leveraging the power of Goroutines, this implementation enables making multiple HTTP requests concurrently, which can significantly reduce the overall execution time of the program. The implementation includes a configurable worker pool size that controls the number of concurrent API requests that can be made at any given time. Additionally, this implementation includes an error handling mechanism that ensures that the program continues to execute even if some of the API requests fail. This repo can serve as a starting point for developers who want to implement Goroutines in their own Go-based API clients or services.
